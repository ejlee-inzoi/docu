# B1AnimNotify_FootSteps

**File:** `BlueClient2/Source/BlueClient/Animation/AnimNotifies/B1AnimNotify_FootSteps.h / .cpp`
**Base Class:** `UAnimNotify`

## Purpose

Plays footstep audio at the notify frame by detecting the physical material of the floor beneath the foot socket and matching it with the character's current shoe outsole type.

## How to Add in the Editor

1. Open an **Animation Montage** or **Animation Sequence**.
2. Right-click on the **Notify track** → **Add Notify** → `B1AnimNotify_FootSteps`.
3. Set `PrintSocketName` to the foot socket (e.g., `foot_l` or `foot_r`) in the **Details panel**.

## Editor Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PrintSocketName` | `FName` | — | Socket on the foot bone used as the trace origin |
| `OptionalSoundId` | `FName` | *(empty)* | Override sound ID; if empty, the sound is auto-selected from the material/outsole lookup table |
| `TraceChannel` | `ECollisionChannel` | `ECC_GameTraceChannel10` | Collision channel for the ground line trace |
| `TraceStartZOffset` | `float` | 100.0 | Z offset above the socket where the trace begins |
| `TraceEndZOffset` | `float` | -150.0 | Z offset below the socket where the trace ends |
| `VolumeMultiplier` | `float` | 1.0 | Volume scale applied to the spawned audio |
| `PitchMultiplier` | `float` | 1.0 | Pitch scale applied to the spawned audio |
| `bFollow` | `bool` | false | If true, the audio component moves with the character |

## Behavior

1. Performs a line trace downward from the foot socket position.
2. Reads the `UPhysicalMaterial` from the hit surface.
3. Determines the shoe outsole type from `UB1AppearanceComponent` on the character.
4. Looks up the matching `FB1FootStepsAudioTableRow` using material + outsole combination.
5. Loads and spawns the audio via `UB1AudioManager` (2D or attached depending on `bFollow`).
6. Sets the `MoveVelocity` parameter on the audio component to match character speed.
